# Stash SDK for Unity ![buildtest](https://github.com/stashgg/stash-unity/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

This package is designed to get your Unity project up and running with the Stash web shop in just a few steps. The package is lightweight and wraps Stash API endpoints without any external dependencies. 

To get started, you need to import the latest package from the [releases](https://github.com/stashgg/stash-unity/releases) section and follow our [Unity guide](https://docs.stash.gg/docs/configure-unity-project).

## Requirements

The Stash package always targets the latest LTS version of Unity. We recommend you use the LTS version of Unity to build projects that are in production or about to ship. However, you should not encounter any issues when integrating or migrating into any other versions of Unity above the targeted release.


## Components

All components are optional, you can mix and match based on your needs.
